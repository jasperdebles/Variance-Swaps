This is a self-chosen assignment for the course Asset and Portfolio Management, part of the MSc. Mathematical Finance curriculum at UNC Charlotte. 

The VIX stands for volatility index and displays the variance or volatility of the S&P 500. One can hedge with variance or volatility swaps by betting that the future realized volatility will be higher or lower than the current implied volatility.
